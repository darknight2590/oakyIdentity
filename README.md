# oakyIdentity
This script was made for private purposes first but I stopped my server and dont need this script anymore. Maybe you can use it :D

# Features
* Runs on ESX 1.2, 1.1 & legacy
* PSD Included
* ID Card & Firearms & Driver License

## To get a license, driver license or weapon license from a player use the following event:
<b>Client to Server</b><br>
<code>TriggerServerEvent('oakyIdentity:server:getIdentity', target, type)</code><br>
<b>target - Server ID of the target</b><br>
<b>type - Available: ident, weapon, license</b>

# FAQ

## How can I implement this in my resource?
Use the event mentioned above. If you still dont know how to do that just learn lua..
